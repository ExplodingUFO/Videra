# Videra.Demo

[English](README.md) | [中文](../../docs/zh-CN/modules/demo.md)

`Videra.Demo` is the sample Avalonia application used to exercise Videra in a real desktop workflow.

## What It Shows

- `VideraView` integration in an Avalonia window
- Backend-ready initialization through `DemoSceneBootstrapper`
- Automatic default demo cube seeding and framing when the backend becomes ready
- High-level model loading with `LoadModelAsync` / `LoadModelsAsync`
- Scene framing with `FrameAll()` after successful load
- Quick camera utilities with `Frame All` and `Reset Camera`
- Render-style and wireframe switching
- Grid visibility, color, and height controls
- Basic object transform editing
- Backend diagnostics via `BackendDiagnostics`, including readiness, native-host binding, and fallback details
- A focused `Scene Pipeline Lab` panel that calls out `SceneDocument` versioning, retained `SceneNode` / `MeshPrimitive` / `MaterialInstance` / `Texture2D` / `Sampler` catalogs, the shipped static glTF/PBR baseline, tangent-aware retained assets, repeated unchanged imports that can reuse retained imported scene assets while they remain retained, deferred upload, render-feature diagnostics, residency counts, atomic scene replacement, and backend-rebind truth

## Runtime Behavior

By default, the demo waits for `VideraView` to finish backend initialization, attaches the importer, and seeds a default demo cube scene through the high-level scene API.

If the default demo cube cannot be created, the demo stays backend-ready, reports the failure in the status area, and keeps model import available. Model import remains available while the status area carries the last scene-bootstrap error.

`PreferredBackend="Auto"` keeps the backend preference aligned with the current platform:

- Windows: Direct3D 11
- Linux: Vulkan
- macOS: Metal

`Program.cs` keeps Windows host options but no longer forces `VIDERA_BACKEND`, so the demo follows the same public backend-selection path described in the repository docs.

For model loading, the demo now calls:

```csharp
var result = await View3D.LoadModelsAsync(paths);
if (result.Succeeded)
{
    View3D.FrameAll();
}

var diagnostics = View3D.BackendDiagnostics;
```

Import results are summarized in the status area. Batch import uses bounded parallel import, and the active scene is replaced only when every requested file succeeds. If any file fails, the active scene stays unchanged and the status area carries the last failure message alongside the success count.

`Import Model`, `Frame All`, and `Reset Camera` follow command/capability readiness rather than a raw `IsBackendReady` XAML assumption, so the visible controls stay aligned with the live importer and viewport wiring.

The `Scene Pipeline Lab` copy in the side panel is deliberate. It projects three internal truths into a user-visible onboarding surface without turning `Videra.Demo` into another broad workstation shell:

- `SceneDocument` is the runtime scene truth, not a mirror of `Engine.SceneObjects`
- imported assets stay CPU-side until a ready resource factory uploads them through the scene upload queue
- imported scene truth stays backend-neutral as `SceneNode`, `MeshPrimitive`, `MaterialInstance`, `Texture2D`, and `Sampler` catalogs
- the retained scene/material runtime baseline is static glTF/PBR: UV-backed texture bindings plus per-primitive non-Blend material participation, metallic-roughness and alpha semantics, emissive and normal-map-ready inputs, occlusion texture binding/strength, `KHR_texture_transform` offset/scale/rotation plus texture-coordinate override, and tangent-aware retained mesh data
- this is imported-asset/runtime truth only; renderer/shader/backend consumption of occlusion or texture-transform metadata is not being claimed here
- mixed Blend/non-Blend imports remain guarded until transparent primitives are independently sortable
- repeated unchanged imports can reuse retained imported scene assets while they remain retained instead of rebuilding ad hoc importer-shaped state
- backend diagnostics surface `document version`, `pending`, `resident`, `dirty`, and `failed` scene-upload counts
- backend diagnostics also surface `SupportedRenderFeatureNames`, `LastFrameFeatureNames`, and `TransparentFeatureStatus` so the public viewer path shows `Opaque`, `Transparent`, `Overlay`, `Picking`, and `Screenshot` truth directly, with `Transparent` meaning alpha mask rendering plus deterministic alpha blend ordering for per-object carried alpha sources
- backend diagnostics explain fallback/rebind behavior while the scene survives backend recreation
- animation, skeletons, morph targets, lights, shadows, post-processing, extra UI adapters, and Wayland/OpenGL/WebGL/backend API expansion are deliberately outside this demo path
